[Tern](https://github.com/marijnh/tern) bindings to the [Chrome Apps API](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/api_index)

These are incomplete, (I just generated by hand the ones I needed.)

A better solution would be generating them from the idl/ like at https://github.com/dart-gde/chrome.dart
or from the API website like https://github.com/aki2o/tern-gas

Pull requests welcome!
